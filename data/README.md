# Enrollment Data Cleaning and Airtable Integration

## Overview

This repository contains my solution to a technical exercise focused on cleaning, structuring, and reviewing enrollment data using Airtable. The work is framed as a simulated internal request and emphasizes clear assumptions, maintainable data modeling, and practical decision‑making.

## Problem Context

The provided CSV represents leader participation in one or more programs. Each record includes compound fields describing leader information, course enrollments, associated cities, and completion status.


## Data Preparation

The raw CSV contained multiple non-atomic, delimiter-separated fields that require cleaning and normalization.
