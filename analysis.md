# Enrollment Data Analysis

## Definitions and Assumptions

* **Engagement** is measured through enrollment counts and average completion percentages, aggregated using rollups across cities, program centers, and courses.
* A minimum-enrollment filter of **≥2 enrollments** is applied when reviewing completion percentages to prevent single enrollments from skewing averages.

## How to Review This Analysis in Airtable

Each section references a specific table and saved view in Airtable:

- **Cities**:  
  - *Cities by Total Enrollment*  
  - *Cities by Avg Completion*

- **Program Centers**:  
  - *Program Centers by Total Enrollment*  
  - *Program Centers by Avg Completion*

- **Courses**:  
  - *Courses by Total Enrollment*  
  - *Courses by Avg Completion*

These views are sorted and filtered to support direct review in Airtable. In addition to tabular views, four summary visualizations were created in Airtable under the *Enrollment Impact Overview* dashboard. These charts highlight enrollment concentration and completion percentage by city and by course, and screenshots are included in the analysis document for reference.

## Summary Observations

To address the Dean's request, enrollment and completion were reviewed across three dimensions: **cities**, **program centers**, and **individual courses**.

### City-Level Engagement

* **Cities by Total Enrollment**
  Cities were ranked by total enrollment volume. The most engaged cities by enrollment included Baltimore, MD; San Francisco, CA; and Austin, TX.

* **Cities by Avg Completion**
  Cities were also reviewed by average completion percentage, with a minimum-enrollment threshold applied to avoid skew from single-participant cases. Top cities by completion percentage included Seattle, WA (95.33%); Austin, TX (93.5%); and San Francisco, CA (92.63%).

### Program Center Engagement

Program-level analysis was used to identify where participation and follow-through are most concentrated across the organization. Given the small number of program centers, results are summarized in tabular form rather than visualized.

* **Program Centers by Total Enrollment**
  BCPI recorded 28 total enrollments, compared to 23 for GovEx. This represents a modest but meaningful difference in participation volume between the two centers.

* **Program Centers by Avg Completion**
  Average completion rates were similar across program centers, with BCPI averaging 89.64% completion and GovEx averaging approximately 87.96%.

### Course-Level Engagement

Enrollments were also reviewed at the individual course level to identify which offerings are driving participation and strong completion.

* **Courses by Total Enrollment**
  Innovation 101 was the most enrolled course with five enrollments. Approximately ten additional courses were tied at three enrollments each, indicating relatively even interest beyond the top offering.

* **Courses by Avg Completion**
  Data Visualization for Leadership (95.5%) recorded the highest average completion rate, followed by Innovation 101 (94.8%) and Public Innovation Lab (94.33%). An additional nine courses exceeded 90% average completion, suggesting strong overall follow-through across the curriculum.

Overall, the data suggests that engagement is geographically concentrated in a small number of cities, while completion rates are generally high across program centers and courses, indicating strong follow-through among enrolled participants.
