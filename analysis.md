# Enrollment Data Analysis

## Definitions and Assumptions

* **Engagement** is defined as enrollment volume and associated completion rates.
* **Completion** reflects numeric course completion percentages provided in the source data.
* Cities, program centers, or courses with very small numbers of enrollments may show high completion averages that are not representative of broader participation.
* Minimum-enrollment filters are applied where appropriate to reduce over-interpretation.

## Summary Observations

To address the Dean's request, engagement and completion were reviewed across three dimensions: **cities**, **program centers**, and **individual courses**.

### City-Level Engagement

* **Cities by Highest Enrollment**
  Cities were ranked by total enrollment volume using rollups on the Enrollments table. The most engaged cities by enrollment included Baltimore, MD; San Francisco, CA; and Austin, TX.

* **Cities by Highest Completion**
  Cities were also reviewed by average completion percentage, with a minimum-enrollment threshold applied to avoid skew from single-participant cases. Top cities by completion percentage included Seattle, WA; Austin, TX; and San Francisco, CA.

### Program Center Engagement

Program-level analysis was used to identify where participation and follow-through are most concentrated across the organization.

* **Program Centers by Enrollment**
  BCPI recorded 28 total enrollments, compared to 23 for GovEx. This represents a modest but meaningful difference in participation volume between the two centers.

* **Program Centers by Completion**
  Average completion rates were similar across program centers, with BCPI averaging approximately 90 percent completion and GovEx averaging approximately 88 percent.

### Course-Level Engagement

Enrollments were also reviewed at the individual course level to identify which offerings are driving participation and strong completion.

* **Courses by Enrollment**
  Innovation 101 was the most enrolled course with five enrollments. Approximately ten additional courses were tied at three enrollments each, indicating relatively even interest beyond the top offering.

* **Courses by Completion**
  Data Visualization for Leadership recorded the highest average completion rate, followed by Innovation 101 and Public Innovation Lab. An additional nine courses exceeded 90 percent average completion, suggesting strong overall follow-through across the curriculum.

Taken together, these views provide a balanced picture of geographic, programmatic, and course-level engagement.
