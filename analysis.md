# Enrollment Data Analysis

## Definitions and Assumptions

* **Engagement** is measured through enrollment counts and average completion percentages, aggregated using rollups across cities, program centers, and courses.
* A minimum-enrollment filter of **≥2 enrollments** is applied when reviewing completion percentages to prevent single enrollments from skewing averages.

## How to Review This Analysis in Airtable

The findings summarized below are based on stakeholder-facing Airtable views created within the shared base and are intended to be reviewed directly in Airtable.

Each section references a specific table and saved view in Airtable:

- **Cities**:  
  - *Cities by Total Enrollment*  
  - *Cities by Avg Completion*

- **Program Centers**:  
  - *Program Centers by Total Enrollment*  
  - *Program Centers by Avg Completion*

- **Courses**:  
  - *Courses by Total Enrollment*  
  - *Courses by Avg Completion*

These views are sorted and filtered to support direct review in Airtable and serve as the primary visualizations for this analysis.

## Summary Observations

To address the Dean's request, enrollment and completion were reviewed across three dimensions: **cities**, **program centers**, and **individual courses**.

### City-Level Engagement

* **Cities by Total Enrollment**
  Cities were ranked by total enrollment volume using rollups on the Enrollments table. The most engaged cities by enrollment included Baltimore, MD; San Francisco, CA; and Austin, TX.

* **Cities by Avg Completion**
  Cities were also reviewed by average completion percentage, with a minimum-enrollment threshold applied to avoid skew from single-participant cases. Top cities by completion percentage included Seattle, WA; Austin, TX; and San Francisco, CA.

### Program Center Engagement

Program-level analysis was used to identify where participation and follow-through are most concentrated across the organization.

* **Program Centers by Total Enrollment**
  BCPI recorded 28 total enrollments, compared to 23 for GovEx. This represents a modest but meaningful difference in participation volume between the two centers.

* **Program Centers by Avg Completion**
  Average completion rates were similar across program centers, with BCPI averaging approximately 90 percent completion and GovEx averaging approximately 88 percent.

### Course-Level Engagement

Enrollments were also reviewed at the individual course level to identify which offerings are driving participation and strong completion.

* **Courses by Total Enrollment**
  Innovation 101 was the most enrolled course with five enrollments. Approximately ten additional courses were tied at three enrollments each, indicating relatively even interest beyond the top offering.

* **Courses by Avg Completion**
  Data Visualization for Leadership recorded the highest average completion rate, followed by Innovation 101 and Public Innovation Lab. An additional nine courses exceeded 90 percent average completion, suggesting strong overall follow-through across the curriculum.

Overall, the data suggests that engagement is geographically concentrated in a small number of cities, while completion rates remain consistently high across program centers and courses, indicating strong follow-through once participants enroll.
