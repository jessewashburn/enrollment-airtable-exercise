# Enrollment Data Analysis

## Definitions and Assumptions

* **Engagement** is measured through enrollment counts and average completion percentages, aggregated using rollups across cities, program centers, and courses.
* A minimum-enrollment filter of ≥2 enrollments is applied when reviewing completion percentages to prevent single-participant cases from skewing averages; in this dataset, the filter does not materially change rankings but provides a safeguard for future or expanded data.

## How to Review This Analysis in Airtable

The findings summarized below are based on stakeholder-facing Airtable views and visualizations created within the shared base.

### Tabular Views

Each section references a specific table and saved view in Airtable:

* **Cities**

  * *Cities by Total Enrollment*
  * *Cities by Avg Completion*

* **Program Centers**

  * *Program Centers by Total Enrollment*
  * *Program Centers by Avg Completion*

* **Courses**

  * *Courses by Total Enrollment*
  * *Courses by Avg Completion*

These views are sorted and filtered to support direct review in Airtable.

### Dashboard Visualizations

In addition to tabular views, four summary visualizations were created in Airtable under the **Enrollment Impact Overview** dashboard. These charts highlight enrollment concentration and completion percentage by **city** and by **course**. Screenshots of these visualizations are included in this analysis document for reference.

## Summary Observations

To address the Dean's request, enrollment and completion were reviewed across three dimensions: **cities**, **program centers**, and **individual courses**.

### City-Level Engagement

City-level analysis was used to identify where participation is most concentrated geographically and to compare completion outcomes across cities.

* **Cities by Total Enrollment** - Cities were ranked by total enrollment volume. The most engaged cities by enrollment included Baltimore, MD; San Francisco, CA; and Austin, TX.

* **Cities by Avg Completion** - Cities were also reviewed by average completion percentage, with a minimum-enrollment threshold applied to avoid skew from single-participant cases. Top cities by completion percentage included Seattle, WA; Austin, TX; and San Francisco, CA.

### Program Center Engagement

Program-level analysis was used to identify where participation and follow-through are most concentrated across the organization. Given the small number of program centers, results are summarized in tabular form rather than visualized.

* **Program Centers by Total Enrollment** - BCPI recorded 28 total enrollments, compared to 23 for GovEx. This represents a modest but meaningful difference in participation volume between the two centers.

* **Program Centers by Avg Completion** - Average completion rates were similar across program centers, with BCPI averaging 89.64% completion and GovEx averaging approximately 87.96%.

### Course-Level Engagement

Enrollments were also reviewed at the individual course level to identify which offerings are driving participation and strong completion.

* **Courses by Total Enrollment** - Innovation 101 was the most enrolled course with five enrollments. Approximately ten additional courses were tied at three enrollments each, indicating relatively even interest beyond the top offering.

* **Courses by Avg Completion** - Data Visualization for Leadership recorded the highest average completion rate, followed by Innovation 101 and Public Innovation Lab. An additional nine courses exceeded 90% average completion, suggesting strong overall follow-through across the curriculum.

## Conclusion

Overall, engagement is geographically concentrated in a small number of cities, with the top three cities by total enrollment accounting for approximately 45% of overall participation. In contrast, completion rates remain consistently high across program centers and courses, indicating strong follow-through once participants enroll.
